    Compare 8 and 3. Swap them, as 3 is smaller. Result: [3, 8, 7, 2, 5]
    Compare 8 and 7. Swap them, as 7 is smaller. Result: [3, 7, 8, 2, 5]
    Compare 8 and 2. Swap them, as 2 is smaller. Result: [3, 7, 2, 8, 5]
    Compare 8 and 5. Swap them, as 5 is smaller. Result: [3, 7, 2, 5, 8]

Pass 2:

    Compare 3 and 7. No swap needed. Result: [3, 7, 2, 5, 8]
    Compare 7 and 2. Swap them, as 2 is smaller. Result: [3, 2, 7, 5, 8]
    Compare 7 and 5. Swap them, as 5 is smaller. Result: [3, 2, 5, 7, 8]

Pass 3:

    Compare 3 and 2. Swap them, as 2 is smaller. Result: [2, 3, 5, 7, 8]
    Compare 3 and 5. No swap needed. Result: [2, 3, 5, 7, 8]

Pass 4:

    Compare 2 and 3. No swap needed. Result: [2, 3, 5, 7, 8]
