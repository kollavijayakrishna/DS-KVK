Linked List Example:

Scenario: Managing a To-Do List Application

In a to-do list application, a linked list can be used to manage the tasks that users need to complete. Each node in the linked list represents a task, containing information such as the task description, deadline, priority, etc. The nodes are connected in a sequence based on the order in which tasks are added or prioritized. This allows for efficient insertion, removal, and traversal through the to-do list, enabling users to stay organized and track their tasks effectively.

2. Data Structure Suitability:

Linked List Suitability:

A linked list is suitable for managing a to-do list in a to-do list application because:

Insertion and deletion operations are efficient, allowing users to add or remove tasks quickly as needed.
The sequential order of linked list nodes preserves the order in which tasks were added or prioritized, ensuring that users can maintain the chronological or prioritized sequence of their tasks.
Linked lists can dynamically resize to accommodate varying numbers of tasks, providing flexibility in managing to-do lists of different sizes without wasting memory.

3. Coding:


class Task:
    def __init__(self, description, deadline, priority):
        self.description = description
        self.deadline = deadline
        self.priority = priority
        self.next_task = None

class ToDoList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        self.size = 0

    def add_task(self, description, deadline, priority):
        new_task = Task(description, deadline, priority)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_task
        else:
            current_task = self.head
            while current_task.next_task:
                current_task = current_task.next_task
            current_task.next_task = new_task
        self.size += 1

    def display_tasks(self):
        current_task = self.head
        while current_task:
            print(f"Task: {current_task.description}, Deadline: {current_task.deadline}, Priority: {current_task.priority}")
            current_task = current_task.next_task

# Accepting input for to-do list size
todo_list_size = int(input("Enter the number of tasks in your to-do list: "))
todo_list = ToDoList()

# Adding tasks to the to-do list
for i in range(todo_list_size):
    description = input(f"Enter description of task {i+1}: ")
    deadline = input(f"Enter deadline for task {i+1} (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD): ")
    priority = input(f"Enter priority of task {i+1}: ")
    todo_list.add_task(description, deadline, priority)

# Displaying the to-do list
print("To-Do List:")
todo_list.display_tasks()



2. Real-Life Scenario:

Binary Tree Example:

Scenario: Organizing a Social Network's Friend Network

In a social network application, a binary tree can be used to organize the friend network of users. Each node in the binary tree represents a user, with the root node representing the user's account. The left child node represents the user's "left" friend (e.g., friend with whom they interact less frequently), while the right child node represents the user's "right" friend (e.g., friend with whom they interact more frequently). This hierarchical structure reflects the varying degrees of closeness in user friendships and allows for efficient traversal of the friend network for tasks such as suggesting new connections or prioritizing updates from closer friends.

2. Data Structure Suitability:

Binary Tree Suitability:

A binary tree is suitable for organizing a social network's friend network because:

It provides a hierarchical representation of user friendships, capturing the varying degrees of closeness and interaction frequency between users.
Binary trees support efficient traversal algorithms, such as in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal, which can be utilized to navigate through the friend network for various tasks.
The balanced nature of binary trees ensures relatively uniform access times for user information, promoting efficient operations even in large social networks with millions of users.

3. Coding:

class User:
    def __init__(self, username):
        self.username = username
        self.left_friend = None
        self.right_friend = None

class SocialNetwork:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = None

    def add_user(self, username, left_friend=None, right_friend=None):
        user = User(username)
        if not self.root:
            self.root = user
        else:
            self._add_user_recursive(user, self.root, left_friend, right_friend)

    def _add_user_recursive(self, new_user, current_user, left_friend, right_friend):
        if current_user is None:
            return
        if current_user.username == left_friend:
            if current_user.left_friend is None:
                current_user.left_friend = new_user
        elif current_user.username == right_friend:
            if current_user.right_friend is None:
                current_user.right_friend = new_user
        else:
            self._add_user_recursive(new_user, current_user.left_friend, left_friend, right_friend)
            self._add_user_recursive(new_user, current_user.right_friend, left_friend, right_friend)

    def display_friend_network(self, node=None, level=0):
        if not node:
            node = self.root
        if node:
            self.display_friend_network(node.right_friend, level + 1)
            print("\t" * level, node.username)
            self.display_friend_network(node.left_friend, level + 1)

# Accepting input for friend network
social_network = SocialNetwork()
while True:
    username = input("Enter username of user (or type 'done' to finish): ")
    if username.lower() == "done":
        break
    left_friend = input(f"Enter username of {username}'s left friend (or leave blank if none): ")
    right_friend = input(f"Enter username of {username}'s right friend (or leave blank if none): ")
    social_network.add_user(username, left_friend, right_friend)

# Displaying the friend network
print("Friend Network:")
social_network.display_friend_network()
