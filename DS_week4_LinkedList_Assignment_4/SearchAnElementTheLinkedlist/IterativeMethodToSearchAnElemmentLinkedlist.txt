The iterative approach for searching an element in a linked list is both direct and efficient.

Initialization:
Commence with a pointer variable named "current," directed towards the head of the linked list.
Introduce a variable to hold the target element you aim to find, referred to as the "target."

Iteration Through the List:
While the "current" pointer is not NULL (indicating the end of the list hasn't been reached):
Compare the data stored in the node currently pointed to by "current" with the target element.
If a match is found, the element has been located! Terminate the loop and return a success signal (e.g., true) or the node itself, if needed.
If there's no match, proceed to the next node in the list by updating "current" to point to "current->next."

Incomplete Search:
If the loop concludes without finding the element (when "current" becomes NULL), it signifies that the element isn't present in the list. Provide a failure indication (e.g., false).

Key Observations:
This technique involves systematically traversing the list, examining each node's data against the target element.
The time complexity is O(n), where "n" denotes the number of nodes in the list, since all nodes might need to be visited in the worst-case scenario.
Only a constant amount of extra space is necessary for the pointers and variables.
Generally favored over the recursive approach due to its iterative nature and superior memory efficiency.

Additional Insights:
Depending on the implementation, the function might return the position of the element instead of a mere success/failure flag.
Some variations, such as the "move-to-front" strategy, involve optimizations like relocating the found element to the head of the list to expedite future accesses.
